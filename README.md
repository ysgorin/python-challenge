This repo contains two scripts, PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank

This author was tasked with creating a Python script that analyzes a financial dataset.
The dataset contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."
The following are calculated with the PyBank script:
* Total number of months in the dataset
* Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Average monthly change in "Profit/Losses"
* Greatest increase in profits over the entire period
* Greatest descrease in profits over the entire period

Results are printed in the terminal and outputted to a .txt file.
