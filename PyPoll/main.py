# In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small,
# rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

# You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv.
# The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".
# Your task is to create a Python script that
# analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

# The total number of votes cast

# A complete list of candidates who received votes

# The percentage of votes each candidate won

# The total number of votes each candidate won

# The winner of the election based on popular vote

# Your analysis should align with the following results:

# Election Results
# -------------------------
# Total Votes: 369711
# -------------------------
# Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
# Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
# Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
# -------------------------
# Winner: Diana DeGette
# -------------------------
# In addition, your final script should both
# print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
